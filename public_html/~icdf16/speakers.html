He has investigated various applications such as computational modeling for biological/agricultural systems, neural networks, space agriculture and sensor network. He published books and papers in fields of environment control engineering, artificial intelligence, conscious studies and sensor networks. He is interested in also quantum physics for biology and fundamental studies in living systems such as complex systems, evolution and self-organization. He invented Field Server, which is a sensor node to monitor environment and ecosystems in real-time. So far he has deployed the Field Servers in Japan, United States, China, Thailand, Korea, Nepal, India and so on. Since 2015, Oct., he is studying for CREST project, “Knowledge Discovery by Constructing AgriBigData”, as the leader.</p>

								<p>I did a first degree in mechanical engineering at Imperial College in 1973, and then did a PhD in tribology there. In 1977 I moved to Bath University's Department of Mathematical Sciences to do research in stochastic computational geometry. I then spent several years as the head of Bath's Microprocessor Unit in what is now Bath University Computing Services. In 1984 I took up a lectureship in manufacturing in Bath's Department of Mechanical Engineering and was subsequently promoted to senior lecturer. I retired in 2012 to concentrate on the RepRap Project and my company RepRapPro Ltd (see below). My main areas of research are geometric modelling and geometric computing in general (I am one of the creators of the Bowyer-Watson algorithm for Voronoi diagrams), the application of computers to manufacturing, and the engineering use of biology, called Biomimetics.  In Biomimetics I work on self-copying and self-assembly in engineering. I am the originator of the worldwide RepRap !</p>
								<p>Project - a project that has created humanity's first general purpose self-replicating manufacturing machine.  I am also a founder and director of RepRapPro Ltd - a company formed to sell RepRap kits and RepRap-related products and services. I was born in London in 1952.  I am married and have one daughter.</p>
